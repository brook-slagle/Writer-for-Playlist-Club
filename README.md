> Writer for Playlist Club.Web application that returns a copy-able and edit-able write-out of a selected Spotify Playlist. Utilizing TypeScript, querying the Spotify API via OAuth authorization. Even though this is available to use on the internet, due to how spotify's API works, I would have to add everyone who wanted to use the app's email to my list of approved users. See "Usage" to run locally.
